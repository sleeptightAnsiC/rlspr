# rlspr
Simple clone of classic WindowsNT's Minesweeper game, written in C99 with Raylib.
I was looking for a reason to try Raylib for a long time and recently,
while I was scattering through WINE's directories on Linux,
I've spotted a similar clone there - `C:\windows\system32\winemine.exe` -
this trully inspired me to give it a try.
In polish versions of Windows this game is called "Saper",
that's why the project's name is `rlspr` as it stands for "Raylib's Saper".
