# TODO
- those files has been taken from mtpl project, clean them up later
- change file name 'lib' to 'dep'
- fix issues with building Raylib while using: make CFLAGS=''
- (in far future) replace current draw pass with GLSL shader


# rlspr
Simple (but faithful) clone of classic WindowsNT's Minesweeper game.\
Created with Raylib, written in C99 - builds and runs everywhere on everything!


# context (why rlspr has been made)
I was looking for a reason to try Raylib for a long long time and recently,
while I was scattering through WINE's directories on Linux,
I've spotted a similar clone there - `C:\windows\system32\winemine.exe` -
this trully inspired me to give it a try.

In polish versions of Windows this game is called "Saper",
that's why the project's name is `rlspr` as it stands for "Raylib's Saper".
